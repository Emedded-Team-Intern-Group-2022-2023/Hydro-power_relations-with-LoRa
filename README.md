# Hydro-power_relations-with-LoRa
This project aims to use IoT to correct weather related data around Dams in Kenya and this data will be used to correlate changes with amount of power that can be generated when dams are full and while running dry.
Data will be saved in a NoSQL database (Firebase) in this case  https://mini-stations--ilab-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
